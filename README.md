This repository hosts the code and resources dedicated to the analysis of hateful memes.<br>
Please find the dataset at the below link<br>
https://hatefulmemeschallenge.com/<br>
Dataset is almost of the size 4GB hence i didn't upload it here in my GitHub repo<br>  
I have worked on colab notebook hence to access the dataset please upload it as it is to Google Drive and mount the drive to colab.<br>
You can then access the directories of dataset by importing the os model as demonstrated in the notebook <br>
